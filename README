Also you need a config file "config.json" at the top level that looks like
{
	"couch": {
		"host": "localhost",
		"port": "5984",
		"name": "poem-db",
		"username": "db-username",
		"password": "db-password"
	}
}

Optionally you can add a "prod" to the config file, making it look like so
{
	"couch": {
		"host": "localhost",
		"port": "5984",
		"name": "poem-db",
		"username": "db-username",
		"password": "db-password"
	},
	"prod": {
		"couch": {
			"host": "localhost",
			"port": "5984",
			"name": "poem-db",
			"username": "db-username",
			"password": "db-password"
		}
	}
}
